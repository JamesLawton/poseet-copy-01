      - title: Unlock your best form
        content: >
          We analyze your form to measure every success. Do you make more
          freethrows on the basketball court when you increase the angle of your
          elbow? How about how far a golf ball travels depending the rotation of
          your hips during the swing? These insights are normally hard to see,
          but poseet helps reveal what works best for you.
