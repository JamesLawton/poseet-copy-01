      - title: Deliberate Practice
        content: >
          Practice, deliberately. We analyze your form to measure every success.
          Do you make more freethrows on the basketball court when you increase
          the angle of your elbow? How about how far a golf ball travels
          depending the rotation of your hips during the swing? These insights
          are normally hard to see, but poseet helps reveal what works best for
          you. Research has shown that deliberate practice enhances the learning
          process and acquisition of skills.
